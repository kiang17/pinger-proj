<!-- NOTE: main use case for this being list item with 
    or without an image -> if had more time the plan was to try to add
    ng-content on line 4 in order to make it a bit more dynamic ->
    (e.g. would be able to add some more information on the 
    competitions list on the home page while still using this component )
